## Project Climb
Co-op platformer. Goal: make a complete game from scratch in exactly 1 month (release date: 20/6/21) while learning a new language (Haxe).
### Controls (TBA)
Move with arrows. Hop with up. Attack (magic) with button 1. Super Jump with button 2.
### TODO
 - Make a basic 2D engine (because I'm a masochist)

 - Add LDtk support
 - Add enemies
 - Add all controls
 - Add character+magic select
