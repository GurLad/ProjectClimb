Day 0 (20/5):
Setting up the dev enviornment (VSCode) and installing all required libraries.
Day 1 (21/5):
I've spent 2 hours creating a basic engine & logic (Vectors, Rectangles, Entities, Renderers, Game loop). I have a white cube, like Blender! I already hate Haxe - no function overloading, weird operator overloading, no normal abstract classes, no protected... Oh well.
Day 2 (22/5):
Began working on PhysicsEntity. It was a nightmare. Collision detection isn't fun. It still has a glaring issue, but I'll fix it next time.
Day 3 (23/5):
Turns out the physics bug was because I used overlapsX instead of overlapsY to determine Y collisions. Oops. I began a rework for nothing. Anyway, these things are mostly irrelevant, as most collisions will be Trigger anyway. And yet, I wasted ~1.5 days on this. Oh well. Should add LDtk support next.
(Also, the first time I build each time, the physics break for no apparent reason (and work properly every time once I rerun it). Why, Haxe?)
